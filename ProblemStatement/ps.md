# Problem Statement

Creators often struggle to monetize their intellectual property fairly, facing opaque licensing systems, limited access to global markets, and centralized platforms that capture most of the value. Traditional methods offer little transparency, flexibility, or community ownership. CreatorFund DAO solves this by turning IP into programmable, tradable assets with decentralized revenue-sharing models.

## 1. Fragmented IP Monetization for Creators

- **Source:** [WIPO - "Copyright and the Creative Economy" (2023)](https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4569)  
  > Highlights that **many creators lack direct access to global IP monetization channels**, relying on intermediaries who capture disproportionate value.

- **Source:** [Creative Commons - "State of Creative Licensing" (2023)](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/arts-culture/state-of-creative-licensing-2023/)  
  > Points to **fragmented licensing standards across platforms**, leading to confusion and limiting creatorsâ€™ ability to monetize across ecosystems.

## 2. Lack of Transparent Royalty Tracking

- **Source:** [IFPI - "Global Music Report" (2024)](https://www.ifpi.org/resources/)  
  > Reports persistent **issues with opaque royalty distribution**, with creators often not receiving fair shares from streaming or licensing deals.

- **Source:** [World Bank - "Intellectual Property for Development" (2023)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/intellectualproperty)  
  > States that **lack of transparent financial infrastructure** for IP monetization disproportionately affects independent and small-scale creators.

## 3. Barriers to Fractional IP Ownership

- **Source:** [MIT Media Lab - "Tokenizing Intellectual Property" (2023)](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/ip-tokenization/)  
  > Highlights the potential of **fractional IP ownership to democratize access to creative economies**, but notes limited adoption due to technical complexity.

- **Source:** [Stanford Law School - "IP and Blockchain: A Legal Overview" (2024)](https://law.stanford.edu/publications/ip-and-blockchain/)  
  > Finds that **fractional ownership models for IP are legally viable but lack user-friendly, creator-centric marketplaces**.

## 4. No Unified Standard for Programmable IP Licensing

- **Source:** [Story Protocol - "Introducing Programmable IP Licenses" (2024)](https://storyprotocol.xyz/blog/programmable-ip-licenses)  
  > Introduces **Programmable IP Licenses (PILs)** as a standardized mechanism for creators to customize and enforce usage rights on-chain.

- **Source:** [Ethereum Foundation - "Onchain Licensing for IP Assets" (2024)](https://ethereum.foundation/research/ip-onchain-licensing/)  
  > Emphasizes that **open standards for programmable licensing** are essential for **creator-led economies** in Web3, yet adoption is still early-stage.
