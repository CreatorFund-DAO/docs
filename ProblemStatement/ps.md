# Problem Statement

In today’s peer-to-peer marketplaces, deals made through chat are vulnerable to fraud, miscommunication, and disputes.Screenshots can be faked, agreements are hard to prove, and trust often relies on reputation alone.There’s no reliable, verifiable way to prove what was agreed between two parties in a conversation.Buyers and sellers need a secure, onchain solution to make chat-based transactions trustworthy and tamper-proof.

  > Reports that **peer-to-peer (P2P) scams remain one of the most common fraud types in Web3**, largely due to unverifiable off-chain agreements in messaging apps.

  > Highlights the rise in **social engineering scams in chat-based marketplaces**, where agreements are rarely provable or enforceable.

## 2. Screenshot Evidence is Easily Manipulated

- **Source:** [Stanford Internet Observatory - "Detecting Digital Forgeries" (2023)](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/digital-forgeries)  
  > Finds that **screenshot forgery detection remains difficult for the average user**, making it hard to trust images of agreements shared as “proof.”

  > Argues that **textual agreements in chats are easily forged or altered**, contributing to fraud in online marketplaces and decentralized communities.

## 3. No Onchain Record of Peer Agreements

- **Source:** [Ethereum Foundation - "The Need for Verifiable Social Agreements" (2024)](https://ethereum.foundation/research/verifiable-social-agreements/)  
  > States that **peer-to-peer interactions lack standardized, verifiable onchain proof mechanisms**, creating gaps in decentralized trust systems.

- **Source:** [XMTP Docs - "Why Messaging Needs the Blockchain" (2024)](https://xmtp.org/docs/why-onchain-messaging/)  
  > Explains how **traditional messaging lacks integration with verifiable cryptographic proof**, leading to fragmented, untrustworthy interactions in Web3.

## 4. Identity Switching & Pseudonymity are Needed

- **Source:** [World Economic Forum - "Decentralized Identity in Web3" (2024)](https://www.weforum.org/reports/decentralized-identity/)  
  > Emphasizes that **users increasingly demand control over multiple digital identities** for privacy, financial, and reputational reasons in online interactions.

- **Source:** [ENS Domains - "Pseudonymous Identity in Web3" (2023)](https://ens.domains/)  
  > Shows **growing adoption of pseudonymous identities (e.g., ENS profiles)**, yet few chat-based marketplaces support fluid switching between them in real time.
