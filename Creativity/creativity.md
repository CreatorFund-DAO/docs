# Creativity

Creativity in TradeTalk lies in transforming casual chat into verifiable commerce. By introducing Proof of Conversation, programmable agents, and wallet-based identity switching inside secure messages, it reimagines messaging as a trust layer for transactions. This unlocks pseudonymous, onchain deal-making something legacy chat platforms can’t offer.
