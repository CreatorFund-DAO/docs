# Real-World Relevance

In the real world, informal deals often happen over chats with no clear proof or enforceability. TradeTalk brings verifiable trust to these conversations by turning agreements into cryptographically signed, onchain records. This is essential for freelancers, marketplaces, DAO contributors, and anyone making financial or service agreements online. It bridges the gap between casual negotiation and enforceable commitment.

## 1. Informal Deals Lack Verifiable Proof

**The Challenge:**  
In freelance work, peer-to-peer trading, and DAO collaborations, many agreements happen over casual chat with no verifiable proof leading to disputes or scams.

**TradeTalk Solves It With:**  
- **Proof of Conversation** → Immutable, onchain agreement records  
- Cryptographic signatures by both parties  
- Verifiable agreements that can resolve future disputes

## 2. Identity Confusion in Marketplace Transactions

**The Challenge:**  
Buyers and sellers often use the same identity across platforms, risking privacy loss or brand dilution when engaging in multiple roles.

**TradeTalk Solves It With:**  
- **Wallet-based persona switching** → Use different onchain profiles for buyer, seller, or DAO roles  
- Enhanced privacy, professionalism, and identity management  
- Flexibility without sacrificing accountability

## 3. Trust Gaps in Decentralized Marketplaces

**The Challenge:**  
Without trusted intermediaries, onchain marketplaces struggle with ensuring fair, enforceable deals between strangers.

**TradeTalk Solves It With:**  
- **Agent-powered agreement finalization** directly inside chat  
- Automation of metadata capture and onchain proofs  
- Trustless negotiation flow built entirely in messaging

As crypto adoption rises, users expect secure, pseudonymous, yet verifiable transaction experiences native to Web3.

**TradeTalk Solves It With:**  
- End-to-end encrypted messaging via **XMTP**

- Bridging casual negotiation with enforceable, onchain commitment
