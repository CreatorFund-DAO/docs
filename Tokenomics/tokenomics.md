## Token Utility

| Use Case                      | Purpose                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Protocol Fees**             | Pay protocol fees on funding, licensing, and royalty distribution events. Partial burns maintain scarcity.   |
| **Staking for Participation** | Creators stake \$CFD to launch funding campaigns, ensuring commitment and spam prevention.                   |
| **Yield Boosts**              | IP-backed assets or participation in funding rounds can yield additional \$CFD rewards.                      |
| **Governance**                | \$CFD holders propose and vote on key decisions: treasury allocations, funding strategies, and new features. |
| **Creator Reputation**        | Stake \$CFD to increase discoverability and reputation weight on featured creator campaigns.                 |
| **Partner Incentives**        | DAOs, protocols, and platforms integrating with CreatorFund receive \$CFD for ecosystem alignment.           |

## Token Distribution

| Category                           | Allocation | Description                                                                         |

| **Team & Founders**                | 15%        | Vested over 4 years with 1-year cliff to align long-term incentives.                |
| **Investors & Strategic Partners** | 15%        | For early contributors, seed investors, and aligned creator platforms.              |

## Deflationary Mechanics

* **Fee Burns**: A portion of protocol fees in \$CFD from licensing and royalty transactions is permanently burned.
* **Limited Supply**: Fixed total supply of **1 billion \$CFD** to maintain long-term scarcity.
* **Dynamic Fee Models**: DAO can adjust burn percentages via governance as ecosystem scales.

## Governance Model

| Mechanism                       | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Onchain Voting**              | Token-weighted voting using standard decentralized governance frameworks (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor or Compound Governor Bravo). |
| **Proposal Threshold**          | Minimum stake required to submit governance proposals (e.g., 50,000 \$CFD).                                                        |
| **DAO Treasury**                | Protocol’s treasury managed by token holders for grants, development, creator support, and growth.                                 |
| **Quadratic Voting (Optional)** | To prevent whales dominating decisions, quadratic voting models can be introduced via governance upgrades.                         |

\$CFD empowers creators and their communities to collaboratively build, fund, and grow the next generation of decentralized IP-driven economies—with transparent, participatory governance at the core.
