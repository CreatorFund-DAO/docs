# Introduction

TradeTalk is a secure onchain messaging marketplace built on XMTP and believes in Proof of Conversation.
Buyers and sellers connect through encrypted chats, while an onchain agent facilitates negotiation, generates cryptographic proofs, and ensures agreements are finalized with verifiable signatures.
Every deal comes with immutable proof onchain, eliminating disputes and establishing trust by default.
