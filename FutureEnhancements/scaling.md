--- 

As TradeTalk evolves into a global decentralized marketplace for verified, onchain conversations and commerce, the following enhancements can further drive scalability, trust, and user engagement:

| Layer                     | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Escrow Payment Layer**  | Integrate optional onchain escrow for high-value transactions, providing additional assurance for buyers and seller |
| **Cross-Chain Messaging & Payments** | Enable interaction across multiple chains (e.g., Base, Ethereum, Polygon), allowing users to transact in their preferred ecosystems.       |
| **Automated Dispute Resolution** | Build DAO-governed or agent-assisted dispute resolution systems leveraging Proof of Conversation for fair settlements.   |
| **AI Negotiation Assistants** | Offer AI-powered agents to help users summarize chats, draft offers, or suggest negotiation tactics within the conversation.                   |
| **Referral & Affiliate Rewards** | Introduce onchain referral systems to incentivize network growth, with programmable commission splits.  |
| **Programmable Persona Marketplace** | Launch a marketplace where users can create, sell, or rent unique AI personas to negotiate or represent them in specific domains.           |
| **Integration with Onchain Identity Frameworks** | Partner with emerging decentralized identity protocols (e.g., Lens, ENS Profiles) for richer identity layers.  |

This keeps it focused, forward-looking, and aligned with TradeTalkâ€™s core vision.
